# Swiss Energy Transition Analysis

## Project Overview

A comprehensive analysis of Switzerland's energy transition, focusing on the relationship between electricity tariffs and renewable energy adoption across cantons (2021-2024).

## Research Questions

1. How do energy tariffs correlate with renewable energy adoption across Swiss cantons?
2. What impact do canton-specific tariff incentives have on solar panel installations?

## Hypotheses

- H1: Higher energy prices correlate with increased solar panel adoption
- H2: Cantons with lower renewable energy tariffs show higher installation rates

## Project Structure

## Current Progress

### Phase 1: Electricity Tariff Analysis ✓

- Comprehensive analysis of tariff components across cantons
- Consumer profile impact assessment
- Temporal trend analysis
- Regional pricing variations

### Phase 2: Renewable Energy Adoption ✓

- Solar panel installation data analysis
- Canton-specific adoption rate patterns

## Key Findings with Visualizations (Phase 1)

## Key Findings with Visualizations (Phase 2)

## Data Sources

- Median Electricity Tariff Dataset (ElCom)
- Energy Reporter Dataset (upcoming)

## Model

Regression
X -> Y

X = Energy Price, Incentives
Y = Solar Power Installed

period in canton (month, canton): X[Energy Price, Incentives] -> Y(Solar Power Installed)

Aligned Data set:
canton, month, Energy Price, Solar Power Installed
