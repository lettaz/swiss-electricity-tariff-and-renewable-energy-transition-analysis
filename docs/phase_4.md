# Next steps

1. Predictions
   - train the model using predictions?
   - train the model on the first 3 years and show the accuracy on the 4 year
   - use the model to predict solar adoption in the future given different energy price scenarios (stable, increaing, decreasing)
2. Simulate more data or find more data sets
   - create a simulation model which generates enery priceses and solar adoption with different behaviors (positive, negative and no correlation)
   - more solar adoption data https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/elektrizitatsproduktionsanlagen
   - train the model using more data and explore optimizing hyperparameters to get the best fit
3. Try different model:
   - solar installed in that year (Dec - Jan power) vs price
   - if political aspect is added a NN might be better
